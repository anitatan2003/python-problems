        "In this notebook, we will practice trying to predict the weather. We won't try to predict it in the sense you are familiar with, where meteorologists try to predict what the weather will be a week out from now. Instead, we will do a simpler example where we look at various information about a day and try to predict the maximimum temperature that day.\n",

        "* You will use a `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `sklearn.tree` instead of a `DecisionTreeClassifier`\n",
        "* You will use the `mean_squared_error` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module instead of `accuracy_score`. It behaves similarly in the sense it takes the true labels and the predicted labels, but is different in that it returns the **error** of the predictions instead. Formally, this is returning the mean-squared error between your predictions and the true values (find the difference for each example, square them, and average them). A higher MSE means the model did worse, while an MSE of 0 means there were no errors!\n",

        "* `labels` should store the `Series` of labels.\n",

        "* `error` should store the error of the trained `model` on the whole dataset.\n",

        "We don't specify each step so that you refer back to your notes and the code process you saw from the notebook earlier in the lesson.
